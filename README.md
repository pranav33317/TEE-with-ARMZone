# TEE-with-ARMZone
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with ARM TrustZone
Objective: Build a trusted I/O system using ARM TrustZone to provide secure execution environments for critical tasks.
Skills Covered:
Embedded systems programming: Develop a secure execution environment for running sensitive computations in a trusted manner.
Security risks: Learn about secure enclave programming, data tampering, and how to safeguard against exfiltration in distributed systems.
Fault-tolerance mechanisms: Ensure system availability and proper operation even when the hardware or software environment encounters faults.
Outcome:
A proof of concept for ARM TrustZone-based secure processing, demonstrating how sensitive data can be securely handled even in an untrusted environment.
Evaluation of the fault-tolerance of the system in the presence of attacks (e.g., side-channel attacks, tampering).
